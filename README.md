### ISLE-K8s project

## Description
An attempt to take a docker-compose file generated by [isle-dc](https://github.com/islandora-devops/isle-dc) and get it running in Kubernetes.

## Status
* Removed Traefik temporarily
* `kubectl apply -k base/` applies correctly, solr does not boot

## How to use
Right now, this has only been tested on Windows 10 2004 with WSLv2 and Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhu-sheridan-libraries/isle-k8s
cd isle-k8s
# ensure kubectl works
kubectl cluster-info
# Create a test namespace to work in
kubectl create namespace isle-development
# Apply the kubernetes yaml using kubectl and kustomize
kubectl -n isle-development apply -k base/
``` 

This will create volumes using hostpath directories and Persistent Volume Claims for all of those. No are setup for ingress or access outside of the cluster yet.
